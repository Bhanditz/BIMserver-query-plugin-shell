Installing
----------

This project depends on quite a few jars that are distributed as part of the main `bimserver-1.4.0-FINAL-2015-11-04.jar`.

You will need the jars `bimserver-1.4.0-FINAL-2015-11-04-shared.jar:bimserver-1.4.0-FINAL-2015-11-04.jar:commons-io-1.4.jar:guava-18.0.jar:slf4j-api-1.6.2.jar` extracted from the main `bimserver-1.4.0-FINAL-2015-11-04.jar` and put on your `CLASSPATH`.

Other than that, it can be built like any normal java project, with the exception that you must include the `plugin` directory into any generated jars.
